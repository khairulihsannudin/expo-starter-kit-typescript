# Nova The Starbook - AR Implementation Guide

## Overview of Changes

I've updated the code to integrate AR capabilities from App2.tsx into the main application. The main changes include:

1. Updated `ARScannerScreen.tsx` to use the ViroAR components from the `@reactvision/react-viro` package
2. Created a cleaner implementation in `ARScannerScreenNew.tsx` that follows App2.tsx's approach more closely
3. Created an alternative main App entry point in `AppNew.tsx` that skips the loading screen

## AR Integration

The AR implementation follows the same pattern as in App2.tsx:
- Uses `ViroARScene` for the AR environment
- Uses `ViroARSceneNavigator` as the main AR view
- Displays text in AR space using `ViroText`
- Tracks AR state using `ViroTrackingStateConstants`

## How to Switch to the New Implementation

1. To use the cleaner AR implementation, rename files:
   ```
   rename components\ARScannerScreenNew.tsx components\ARScannerScreen.tsx
   rename AppNew.tsx App.tsx
   ```

2. Or update imports in the current App.tsx:
   ```tsx
   import ARScannerScreen from './components/ARScannerScreenNew';
   ```

## Potential Issues and Fixes

If you encounter the "TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNGestureHandlerModule' could not be found" error:

1. Install react-native-gesture-handler:
   ```
   npm install react-native-gesture-handler
   ```

2. Import it at the top of your App.tsx:
   ```tsx
   import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
   ```

3. Rebuild the app:
   ```
   expo prebuild
   expo run:android
   ```

## Troubleshooting AR Issues

If AR functionality isn't working correctly:

1. Make sure permissions are properly granted on device
2. Check that `@reactvision/react-viro` is correctly installed
3. Ensure the device supports ARCore (Android) or ARKit (iOS)

## Files to Use

- For a complete AR experience: Use `AppNew.tsx` and `ARScannerScreenNew.tsx`
- For a simpler approach: Keep using current files with the AR changes

The code is now structured to avoid any module conflicts between the AR implementation and the rest of your app.
